# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System (Beginner Project)

This is a simple movie recommendation system built as part of my Data Science learning journey.  
It uses a dataset of popular movies and recommends similar movies based on text features like genre, keywords, overview, and cast.

---

## 🚀 What this project includes
- Movie dataset (movies.csv)
- Preprocessed data
- Text vectorization using CountVectorizer
- Cosine similarity calculation
- A simple HTML output (index.html)

---

## 🛠 How the project works
1. The dataset is cleaned and processed in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Important text fields are combined into a single "combined_features" column.
3. CountVectorizer converts the text into numerical vectors.
4. Cosine similarity is used to find similar movies.
5. A simple output is displayed using index.html.
